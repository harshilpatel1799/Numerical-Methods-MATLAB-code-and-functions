“goodness” of the final	fit f2(t)	
in the comment box. What exactly does the shape & distribu<on of residuals,
and both of the	R2 values tell you?	


The residual diagnostic plot allows us to determine model adquecy for f2(t). A good 
model will have a balanced and random distrubution. The residual plot
indicates there is a cyllical pattern in showing residuals being scattered 
around zero. The expected value of the residuals seem to be zero but there 
is pattern as there is not a constant variance, meaning there is 
proablly an issue with the model be adquete to model the data. 

The R2 value tells us the variation explained by the quadratic model. The 
R2 is very low, meaning the model is not a great fit. Also the R2 reduced 
from the 1st order fit, meaning the new variable/measure that 
corresponds with x^2 is likely not/low in correlation or is a bad indicator 
for curve fitting the data. The model need to be improved with as the
inputs explain about 24% of the variation. We need a model variables
that have high correlation to be adquete to model the data.
