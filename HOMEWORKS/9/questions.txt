i.) 
50.34%


ii.) 
midpoint is much more accurate for any interval size h or #of nodes, as conveyed from HW9_4 plot. This is consistent with our finding in class in looking
at erf(x) from 0 to 1 using midpoint and trapezoid rules.



iii.) 
for midpoint rule error, the slope is 2.0109
for trapeziod rule error, the slope is 2.0103
This consistent as both rules have an error converagnce rate of a quadtratic nature and order of 2 as h/n increase.
